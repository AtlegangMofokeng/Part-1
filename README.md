Part  one of my project contains of a basic HTML structure that has for five diffrent pages which are the  : homepage, about us page, contact us page, store page, and celebrate us page.
After the completion  and submition of part one, there were more changes that I made. For my hompage I  had one image at first, i added more images to the hompage to attract customers,from the images that all a different story to tell.
Part 2 of the POE gave me the task of enhanging my website which one has to do through CSS. CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML.
I started of by changing the colour and font of my words to make my website more eye-catching.
I made a collage for my Homepage.
